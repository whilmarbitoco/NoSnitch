A project for CC104 - Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Features  
- **Post Notes:** Users can post anonymous notes on categorized boards.  
- **Comment on Notes:** Share thoughts and feedback through comments.  
- **Board Categories:** Multiple sections like General, Love, School, and Art for topic-specific discussions.  
- **Automatic Deletion:** Notes are automatically deleted after a specified time.  
- **Login and Sign-Up:** Accounts required to prevent spam and misuse.
